## My process

### Built with

- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code
- git / github.com

### What I learned

- How to set an upstream for a local branch in git (git push -u \<remote\> \<remote-branch\>)
- It is important that you suit your desk and your chair to your anatomy ;)

### Questions

- **Why is the image-container higher than the image itself?** I could solve this with _height: 301px_ but I want to know why. You can see it when hovering the card-image (gap at the bottom of the image).
Or with devtools :)
